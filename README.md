# Facial emotion detection using CNN-LSTM

## Introduction

In this project we explore human recognition system to identify 7 types of emotions by using FER2013 dataset. 
We aim to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using CNN model features to a Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) networks.
This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.


The repository is currently compatible with `tensorflow-2.0` and makes use of the Keras API using the `tensorflow.keras` library.
